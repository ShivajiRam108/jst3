<!-- 3. Scenario: Bank Account System
You are designing a banking system. Each account has an account holder name, account number, and balance. You need to be able to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance of the account.
•             Question:
 How would you define a BankAccount class with properties accountHolderName, accountNumber, and balance?
–            What methods would you include to:
•             Deposit money into the account (e.g., deposit(amount) method)?
•             Withdraw money from the account (e.g., withdraw(amount) method)?
•             Check the current balance (e.g., getBalance() method)? -->
